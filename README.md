## What Makes This Unique

| Feature | Standard Sleep Apps | This Dashboard |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Data Source | Apple Health export | Direct Eight Sleep OAuth2 API |
| Two-Process Model | Not available | Borbély model visualization (Process S + C) |
| Circadian Metrics | Not available | Sleep midpoint, social jetlag, sunrise markers |
| Sleep Variability | Not available | SD of onset, wake, midpoint, duration |
| Hypnogram | Basic or none | Full stage progression with connecting lines |
| Correlations | Not available | Auto-discovered (Duration↔REM, HRV↔HR) |
| HRV Accuracy | Raw values (often 300+ms) | Filtered 10-150ms for realistic readings |
| Multi-session | Averages all sessions | Aggregates per night, filters main sleep |

## Key Features

### Direct Eight Sleep API Integration
- **Custom OAuth2 client** - Reverse-engineered the new authentication flow after Eight Sleep deprecated session tokens
- **Rate limit handling** - Exponential backoff with automatic retry
- **Token refresh** - Seamless re-authentication on expiry

### Clinical-Grade Sleep Metrics
- **Sleep Schedule Variability** - Standard deviation of sleep timing (used in sleep research)
- **Sleep Midpoint** - Clock time at the middle of sleep period with trend visualization
- **Social Jetlag** - Weekday vs weekend sleep timing difference (associated with health risks)
- **Green/Red indicators** - < 60 min SD = consistent, >= 60 min = variable
- **Main sleep detection** - Filters to 6PM-6AM window, keeps longest session per night

### Circadian Science Visualizations
- **Two-Process Model (Borbély)** - Interactive visualization of sleep regulation showing:
  - Process S (homeostatic sleep pressure) - builds during wake, dissipates during sleep
  - Process C (circadian alerting signal) - 24-hour rhythm from the SCN
  - Sleep gate identification - where S exceeds C, indicating optimal sleep timing
- **Sunrise Markers** - Location-based sunrise times shown on sleep timeline
- **Sleep Midpoint Trend** - Dashed line connecting nightly midpoints

### Advanced Visualizations
- **Hypnogram** - Step chart showing sleep stage progression with connecting lines
- **Correlation scatter plots** - Trend lines with r-values
- **Apple-style dark theme** - Professional UI matching iOS aesthetics

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/chung-lab-miami/sleep-dashboard.git
cd sleep-dashboard
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure credentials
echo "EIGHT_SLEEP_EMAIL=your@email.com" > .env
echo "EIGHT_SLEEP_PASSWORD=yourpassword" >> .env
echo "EIGHT_SLEEP_ENABLED=true" >> .env

# Optional: Set location for sunrise calculations (default: Boston)
echo "LATITUDE=42.3601" >> .env
echo "LONGITUDE=-71.0589" >> .env

# Run
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

3. **Sleep Timeline** - 14-day horizontal bar chart with sunrise markers
4. **Hypnogram** - Last night's sleep stage progression
5. **Sleep Variability** - SD metrics with good/high indicators
6. **Circadian Metrics** - Sleep midpoint trend (dashed line), social jetlag
7. **Two-Process Model** - Interactive Borbély model visualization
8. **HR & HRV Trends** - Separate charts with 7-day rolling averages
9. **Correlations** - Duration↔REM, HRV↔HR, HRV↔Awake, Duration↔Deep
10. **AI Analysis** - Optional Qwen-powered insights (requires Ollama)
